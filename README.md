# Election Audit Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to assist Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, on an election audit of the results of a congressional precinct in Colorado. Based on the data we will be determining the total number of votes, votes and percentages for each candidate and county, the largest county turnout, and the winning candidate. Typically, this process would be done in Excel however, Tom’s boss wants to know if there is a way to automate the process in Python and that’s where we come in. The findings of this analysis can then be utilized not only in other state congressional districts but also on a senatorial level. Our work in this analysis is certifying the results of the data from this congressional race in Colorado. If valid, this could revolutionize election audits.
